# A basic window in ![Raylib]\br

Using a Makefile that I set up using the "complete package, except sources" from ![GnuWin](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)  and setting it to Window's PATH variables</br>
The Include and Lib folders are included from raylib's ![release](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases)</br>
what confused me initially was the difference between Raylib's ![github](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) download and the release version
